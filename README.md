# time-series-forecast

If the code does not view in the github viewer, then:
-Go to Google Colab
-Open file
-Open using Github link
-Paste https://github.com/saieeshj/time-series-forecast in the link box and you will see the .ipynb code on which you can click and the code will be visible
The plots in the code are just for a specific set of dataset i.e. fuel(oil) consumption.

If I only change the data set from fuel consumption to volume or price data then the prediction of that dataset will take place.

My report is there in a google drive link in the verification doc
